 * == About this Plugin ====================================================================
 * =========================================================================================
 * This Plugin provides options for customizing the Save/Load screen and   
 * altering the game saving system. Below is a short explanation of the 
 * main features. It is followed by more detailed informations on some of
 * the more intricate features. At the end, you'll find a description for
 * each parameter.
 *
 *
 * Saving system options
 * ===================== 
 *
 *      START FROM LOADING SCREEN:
 *         An optional command that allow to start a New Game from the
 *         Load Screen when selecting an empty file slot.
 *
 *      SINGLE SLOT SYSTEM:
 *         With this option, the players can't select other slots when
 *         saving during the game. Saving always overwrite the current 
 *         file.
 *
 *      AUTO SAVE:
 *         The Plugin provide an optional Auto Saving system. When enabled,
 *         it will save on the currently used file, each times the player
 *         enter a map. This can be managed through Plugin Commands and
 *         parameters.
 *
 *         AUTO SAVE WINDOW:
 *           The Auto Save comes with an optional Auto Save Window. If
 *           enabled, it will pop out each times an Auto Save occurs.
 *     
 *      REGION MAP NAME
 *           Since the Plugin allow to display the Map Name in the save
 *           slots, it provide a system for changing the Map displayed
 *           name according to regions.
 *
 *
 * Customize the Save/Load scenes
 * ==============================    
 * 
 *       FILE WINDOW:
 *         This is the main window where the information from the saved 
 *         files are displayed. You can customize some of its aspects like
 *         its dimension and the number of file slots it contains. 
 *
 *         The file slots are separated in 3 sections. You can decide which
 *         sections you want to display, and in what order. There's also
 *         numerous options to set the datas you want to display in each
 *         sections. Bellow, you'll find furthers explanations on this.
 *         
 *         CUSTOM CURSOR
 *           The Plugin allow to import a custom image to use as a cursor
 *           for the file window. There's a few animation options for your
 *           custom cursor, and the default blinking cursor can be disabled
 *           if desired.
 *
 * 
 *      COMMAND WINDOW:
 *         The command window appears when you select a file slot. It can
 *         provide the following commands:
 *
 *                           -Load   (upload a saved game file)
 *                           -Save   (save or overwrite a file)
 *                           -Delete (erase a file)
 *                           -Start  (new game)
 *                           -Cancel (go back)
 *
 *         The available commands depends on the scene your in (Load or
 *         Save), the selected slot (valid game file or empty slot), and
 *         some of your parameter settings. Each commands can also be 
 *         renamed the way you want.
 *
 * 
 *      HELP WINDOW:
 *         The help window fades in when entering the Load or Save Screen.
 *         It remains on screen a few seconds then fades out. It will keep
 *         popping back out periodically if no input from the player occurs.
 *         You can also set it to stay on screen all the time as does the 
 *         default help window. You can also disable it.
 *         
 * 
 *      CONFIRM WINDOW:  
 *         This optional window appears after a command has been selected
 *         from the command window. The player get to confirm his choice by
 *         selecting Yes or No. You can set the Confirm Text that is shown
 *         in the help window for each commands.
 *         
 *
 *
 * =======================================================================================
 * == File Window Sections ===============================================================
 * =======================================================================================
 * The file window can display 3 sections:
 *
 *          -General Section
 *             Display infos such as Saved File ID and Playing Time.
 *
 *          -Status Section
 *             Display party members images, names and status gauges.
 *
 *          -Progress Section
 *             This is where you can display icons, variables and other
 *             datas related to the game progression. 
 *
 * While the 'general' section is always shown, the 2 others are optionals.
 * The overall look of the slots depends on how many sections is shown, but
 * also depends on the File Window dimension settings.
 *
 *
 * Number of Visible Slots
 * =======================
 * There's a parameter to change to number of visible slots in the file
 * window. This define the available space to show stuff in each slots.
 *
 * Let's say the file window is set to the size of the whole screen. If you 
 * set the number of visible slots to 1, that means each slots will take 
 * the whole screen. Set it to 2 and the slots will be 2 fat rectangles, 
 * each taking about half the screen. The default Plugin setting is 3, which
 * gives 3 rectangle slots, taking about 1/3 of the screen each. The more
 * visible slots you add, the thiner the rectangles becomes, and less space
 * is available for showing datas.
 *
 * 
 * Auto Adjusting
 * ==============
 * Most elements like fontSize, icons and images will scales themselves to
 * fit the available space in their respective sections. Bellow are some
 * examples on how things will position themselves in the slots, depending
 * on different 'sections' settings.
 *
 *    Only general section: 
 *       As said before, the 'general' section is always present. If it is
 *       the only section you show, it's data will be spread in 2 columns,
 *       taking the whole slot space.
 *
 *                 *********************************************
 *                 *                                           *
 *                 *     general                general        *
 *                 *     general                general        *
 *                 *                                           *
 *                 *********************************************
 *
 *    General + section A: 
 *       If you add one optional section (Status or Progress), the general
 *       section datas will form one column taking about 1/3 of the left
 *       part of the slot. The optional section taking the remaining space.
 *
 *                 *********************************************
 *                 *    general    |                           *
 *                 *    general    |         Section A         *
 *                 *    general    |                           *
 *                 *    general    |                           *
 *                 *********************************************
 *
 *    General + sections A and B: 
 *       When showing 2 optional sections, the general section will take
 *       about 1/4 of the left part of the slot. The optional sections
 *       will both be taking half of the remaining space.
 *
 *                 *********************************************
 *                 *  general  |               |               *
 *                 *  general  |   Section A   |   Section B   *
 *                 *  general  |               |               *
 *                 *  general  |               |               *
 *                 *********************************************
 *
 *
 *     As discussed previously, if you set the number of visible slots to 1,
 *     the slots will be taking to whole window. The Plugin have a special
 *     setting for this situation as the slot will have more or less the shape
 *     of a square rather than a rectangle. The disposition of sections in
 *     this case would be as follow:
 *
 *       Only general         1 optional sections        2 optional sections
 *    *******************      *******************       ********************

 *    * general general *      * general general *       * ral  | Section A *

 *    *******************      *******************       ********************
 *
 *               *Sections A and B represent the optional 'status' and
 *                'Progress' sections. which one is A and which one is B 
 *                depends on the order of their entry in the 'Sections 
 *                List' parameter. (see Parameters Description bellow)
 *
 *
 *
 * =======================================================================================
 * == Notes On Using Eval Script Lines === ***Read carefully*** ==========================
 * =======================================================================================
 * Some parameters allow the use of script lines. Using script, you can
 * call any data from the saved files and show anything you want. You can  
 * also make things appears conditionnaly.
 *
 * Extracting data
 * ===============
 * Since it's going to extract data from each saved game files in order 
 * to display them in their respective slots, you need to use a special
 * script syntax.
 *
 *           ***All game objects are stored by their lowercase  
 *              names in the object 'game'.
 *
 *              Example:  $gamePlayer === game.player
 *
 * 
 *           ***Once you call a game object as a property of 'game', 
 *              you can use any function from that game object as
 *              you would normally use.
 *
 *              Example: 
 *         $gameActors.actor(1).name() === game.actors.actor(1).name()
 *                         
 *
 *           ***All game objects can be extracted the same way. Here's
 *              a reference list:
 *
 *                     $gameSystem   ===  game.system
 *                     $gameScreen   ===  game.screen
 *                      $gameTimer   ===  game.timer
 *                   $gameSwitches   ===  game.switches
 *                  $gameVariables   ===  game.variables;
 *               $gameSelfSwitches   ===  game.selfswitches
 *                     $gameActors   ===  game.actors
 *                      $gameParty   ===  game.party
 *                        $gameMap   ===  game.map
 *                     $gamePlayer   ===  game.player    
 *
 *
 *           ***And here's some additional examples of commonly used
 *              script call, so you'll get the point.
 *
 *                    $gameParty.gold() === game.party.gold()           
 *
 *               $gameSwitches.value(X) === game.switches.value(X)
 *
 *   $gameParty.numItems($dataItems[X]) === game.party.numItems($dataItems[X])
 *
 *                     $gameMap.mapId() === game.map.mapId();
 *
 *                        $gamePlayer.x === game.player.x
 *
 *              $gameVariables.value(X) === game.variables.value(X)**
 *
 *          **this last one may appear very useful, but in fact the 
 *            'progress' section allow a more user friendly way of 
 *            showing variables value using text escape code \v[X]. 
 *            See Below.
 *
 *
 *
 * =======================================================================================
 * == Map Name Window (REGION NAMES) =====================================================
 * =======================================================================================
 * The Plugin allow you to set different Display Map Names for different 
 * Map Region Id. To use this feature, simply enter each names in the
 * Display Name entry of the Map Properties, separated by a SEMI COLON.
 * And associate (with ':') each name with a list of region Id, separated
 * by commas.
 *
 *        Example:
 *           Kingdom A: 1,2,5; Kingdom B: 3,4, Great Forest: 6
 *
 *           In this example, the Map Name will be 'Kingdom A' when
 *           in regions 1, 2 and 5. If player is in region 3 or 4,
 *           the Map Name will be 'Kingdom B'; and 'Great Forest'
 *           will be the displayed name when in region 6.**
 *
 *         **The dislayed name is what will be display in the Location
 *           entry of the General Section of the File Window (see bellow).
 *           It is also the name that will be displayed in the Map Name
 *           Window. The Map Name Window will pop out (if it is enabled)
 *           each time the Player steps in a region that have a different 
 *           name than the previous region.
 *
 *       
 *

 * =======================================================================================
 *
 * SAVING SYSTEM 
 * =======================================================================================
 *
 * Start From Load Screen
 * ======================
 *    Allow to start a new game from the Load screen when an empty
 *    file slot is selected. 
 *
 *
 * Enable Single Slot
 * ==================
 *    When this parameter is enabled, any attempt to manually save
 *    the game during gameplay will automatically prompt the player

 *
 *
 * Enable Map Auto Save
 * ====================
 *    If this is enabled, the game will auto save each time the player

 *
 *   **Note that there will be no auto save when you enter the first map
 *     after loading or starting a new game. Auto save is also disabled
 *     if an autorun event is triggered on the map. This is to prevent
 *     the game from auto saving during cut scenes that use multiple maps.

 *    the Save screen.
 *
 *     *** Tips: if you set the alpha value (the last one) of both 
 *               colors to 0, and leave both Help Text blank, the  
 *               Help Window won't show. 
 *
 *
 *
 * CONFIRM WINDOW
 * =======================================================================================
 *
 * Enable Confirm Window

 *
 * BACKGROUNDS
 * =======================================================================================
 * 
 * Screen background Image
 * =======================
 *    This parameter allow to display an image in the background of the
 *    screen (It will be behind all windows, but over the previous scene
 *    in the background). The image must be imported in /img/parallaxes 
 *    in your game folder. Enter the file name without extension.
 *
 *
 * Screen Frame Image
 * ==================
 *    This parameter allow to display an image drawn from /img/titles2 in
 *    your game folder. It will be behind the windows but over the Screen
 *    background Image (if any), and what's behind it. It is mainly meant
 *    to add some 'frame' image around the screen like the default images
 *    in this folder.
 *
 *
 * Saved Files Image
 * =================
 *    This is to draw an image as the background for your slots in the File
 *    Window. The image must be imported in /img/pictures in the game folder.
 *    Enter the file name without extension.
 *
 *    **The image will be behind all the slot contents, but over the default
 *      Blinking Cursor. You migh consider using a Custom Cursor if you plan
 *      to use this feature.
 *
 *    **The image will be scaled to fit the slots size. Try to have an image
 *      that has similar proportion with your slots to avoid distorsion.
 *
 *    **This parameter concern only the background image of slots containing
 *      valid game file. Empty slots will have no images unless you set one
 *      with the next parameter.
 *
 *
 * Empty Files Image
 * =================
 *    This parameter allow to set an image for Empty file Slots. See previous
 *    parameter instructions.
 *   
 *
 * CURSORS
 * =======================================================================================
 *
 * Show Default Cursor
 * ===================
 *    Enable/disable the Default Blinking Cursor with this parameter.
 *
 *
 * Custom Cursor Name
 * ==================
 *    Enter your custom cursor image file name without extension here.
 *    Image must be in /img/pictures in your game folder. By entering
 *    a file name in this parameter, it turn On the custom cursor and
 *    the following parameters becomes available. Erase the name if 
 *    you want to disable the custom cursor.
 *
 *    **Frame Cursor: the custom cursor is meant to behave as a frame
 *                    around the slots. It means it will be scaled to 
 *                    the size of the slots. Try to have an image about
 *                    the same proportions than your slots. You can make
 *                    some part of the image offset the slots with the
 *                    Widht and Height Offset parameters bellow.                   
 *
 *
 * Custom Cursor X Offset
 * ======================
 *    This is the horizontal offset of the custom cursor to adjust it
 *    with the File Window slots.
 *
 *
 * Custom Cursor Y Offset
 * ======================
 *    This is the vertical offset of the custom cursor to adjust it
 *    with the File Window slots.
 *
 *
 * Custom Cursor Width Offset
 * ==========================
 *    Your custom cursor image will be scaled to fit the width of the 
 *    slots. If you have some part of the image that are meant to be
 *    offset with the slots, this parameter tell the Plugin which part 
 *    of the image width should not be considered for scaling calculation.
 *
 *       Example: Your image is 400px of width. But it represent a
 *                frame with spikes each side. You want your image
 *                to be framing around the slots, but the spikes
 *                should remains outside. If the spikes are 50px
 *                long on both side of the image, you would set 
 *                this parameter to -100* to cut 100px of the image
 *                width. The 'Custom Cursor X Offset' might need 
 *                to be adjusted again.
 *
 *                *use negative values to offset part of the cursor
 *                 outside of the slots. Positive values will offset
 *                 the image inside the slots (it shrink the image).
 *
 *
 * Custom Cursor Height Offset
 * ===========================
 *    Your custom cursor image will be scaled to fit the height of the 
 *    slots. If you have some part of the image that are meant to be
 *    offset with the slots, cut the part of the image height that is
 *    not to be considered for scaling calculation.
 *
 *       Example: Your image is 200px of height. But it represent a
 *                frame with spikes on top. You want your image to 
 *                be framing around the slots, but the spikes should 
 *                remains outside. If the spikes are 50px long, you
 *                would set this parameter to -50* to cut 50px of the
 *                image height. The 'Custom Cursor Y Offset' might 
 *                need to be adjusted again.
 *                
 *                *Here again we use a negative value, because we want
 *                 the spikes to be outside of the slots, on top.
 *
 *
 * Cursor Blinking
 * ===============
 *    The custom cursor can be animated with a blinking effect. Turn
 *    it in On and Off with this parameter.
 *
 *
 * Cursor Smooth Move
 * ==================
 *    If this is turn On, the custom cursor will smooth move in between
 *    each slots. The time it take to reach the next slot depends on the
 *    'Cursor Move Speed' parameter. No new input can be made while the 
 *    cursor is moving.
 *
 *
 * Cursor Move Speed
 * =================
 *    This is the 'Speed' of the cursor when smooth moving. It is the
 *    number of pixels by frame so the actual speed depends on screen 
 *    resolution.
 *
 *
 * Cursor Moving Sound
 * ===================
 *    When the cursor is smooth moving, it will make this sound. Enter
 *    a SE name.
 *
 *
 * Cursor OnSlot Sound
 * ===================
 *    When the cursor reach a slot, it will make this sound. Enter a
 *    SE name. 
 *
 *
 *
 * CUSTOM ICONS SHEET
 * =======================================================================================
 * You can import a custom icons sprite sheet in /img/pictures in
 * your game folder. Use it to display specific icons set for your 
 * Load and Save scenes, using escape code '\i[X]'.
 *
 * If you're using TSR_TextColorAddOn.js and have a custom icons
 * sheet set with it, that icons sheet will be disabled while in
 * the Save or Load scenes if you have also set a custom icons 
 * sheet with this Plugin. If you want to use your custom icons
 * from TSR_textColorAddOn in the Save and Load scenes, don't set 
 * a custom icons sheet with this Plugin.
 *
 *
 * Save Scene Icons Sheet Name
 * ===========================
 *    The file name of the sprite sheet in /img/pictures without
 *    file extension. Entering a file name here will turn On the
 *    custom icons sheet and the following parameters becomes
 *    available. Erase the name to disable the custom sprite sheet.
 *
 *
 * Save Scene Icons Start Index
 * ============================
 *    This is the starting icon code for your icon sprite sheet.
 *    Default Plugin value is 500. If you leave it that way, the
 *    icon codes for your custom sprite sheet will start at 500.
 *    That mean writing \I[500] will show the first index of your
 *    sprite sheet, that is the upper left corner frame (index 0).
 *   
 *    If you set the starting index to 0, it will overide all the
 *    default icons, so unless that's what you want, I recommend 
 *    leaving it to 500, or any number that won't overlap with your
 *    main icon set in /img/system.
 *
 *
 * Save Scene Icons Frame Size
 * ===========================
 *    This is the size of one frame in your sprite sheet. The default
 *    icon set is 32x32 pixels icons, but you can use any size you
 *    want. Enter the number in pixels of the size of one frame in your 
 *    custom sheet.
 *
 *
 * Save Scene Icons SpriteByRows
 * =============================
 *    This is to tell the Plugin how many frame (images) are in one
 *    row of the custom sheet. As an example, the default icon sheet
 *    have 16 frames (icons) by rows.
 *
 *
 * Save Scene Icons Auto Scale
 * ===========================
 *    In most cases, when using the icon code '\i[x]' with this Plugin,
 *    icons will auto scale themselves according to the font size, so 
 *    they always look in place and aligned with text. If for any reason,
 *    you need your custom icons to appear in their actual dimension, turn
 *    that parameter OFF.
 *
 *     Example 
 *         We'll use a Battler Sprite sheet as example:
 *
 *              Icons Sheet Name:      Actor1_1        
 *              Sheet Starting Index:  500 (default) 
 *              Sheet Frame Size:      64             
 *              Sheet SpritePerRows:   9
 *              Icons Auto Scale:      true
 *
 *        Now using code \i[500] in a text string will make Harold appear as
 *        an icon scaled to the text. Since Battlers sheet are 9 columns by
 *        6 rows, we can use icon codes from 500 to 553 for the whole sheet.
 *        Using \i[552] for instance will show a very dead Harold icon. 
 *        Turning the Auto scale to false would make Harold icons appear 
 *        as 64x64 pixels images that would most likely clash with the text...
 *
 *
 *    ***Again, the custom icons sprite sheet uploaded with this Plugin  
 *       works only for the Save and Load scenes. But my other Plugin 
 *       TSR_TextColorAddOn allow to set a custom icons sheet that works
 *       for the entire game. If you set both Plugins with a custom icons
 *       sheet, the one from this Plugin will overide those from 
 *       TSR_TextColorAddOn while in the Save or Load scenes, but icons
 *       from TSR_TextColorAddOn will be valid in every other scenes.
 *
 *
 *
 * GENERAL SECTION
 * =======================================================================================
 *
 * Show File Id
 * ============
 *    The saved file Id are displayed in the top left corner of the
 *    slots. You can hide it by turning Off this parameter.
 *
 *
 * General List
 * ============
 *    This is where you tell the Plugin what info you want to show in
 *    the general section, and in what order. Each info is represented
 *    by a specific keyword explained below. Note that all keywords
 *    are case insensitive.
 *
 *          'Playtime': show the time played so far.   
 *
 *          'Location': show the Display Name of the game map where
 *                      the save occurs.
 *        
 *              'Date': show the date* when the file was saved.
 *
 *              'Time': show the time* when the file was saved.
 *
 *           'SavedOn': show both 'Date' and 'Time' on the same line.
 *
 *            'Custom': show the text entered in the 'Custom Text'
 *                      parameter below.
 *
 *                  *Date and Time format vary depending on your
 *                   region/browser.
 *
 *    For each info you want to show, enter the corresponding keyword
 *    in the 'General List' and separate each by a SEMICOLON. 
 *
 *          Example: Location; savedOn; Playtime
 *
 *  LINE BREAKS
 *    The general info list form a column in the left part of the slots
 *    with each entry forming a line (row). FontSize and lineHeight will
 *    decrease slightly as you add more info (lines). Anything between 2
 *    semicolons that isn't a keyword will result in adding line breaks,
 *    and thus, reducing the fontSize. 
 *
 *          Example: Location; none; savedOn; none; Playtime 
 *
 *    In the example above, I used 'none', but it could be anything except
 *    one of the keywords. This will result in adding an empty line between
 *    'Location' and 'savedOn', and between 'savedOn' and 'Playtime'. It will
 *    also adjust the fontSize considering the info is now spread throughout
 *    5 rows.  
 *
 *  TITLES
 *    You can also add titles to each info by linking the keywords to some
 *    text string with an equal '=' sign.
 *
 *          Example: Playtime
 *     
 *             This will just show the play time as '00:00:00'
 *
 *          Example: Play Time: = Playtime
 *
 *             Now this will show: 'Play Time: 00:00:00'
 *
 *    You can add a title this way to each keywords in your 'General List'.
 *    So taking back the first example above, we could write:
 *
 *     Location: = Location; Saved On: = savedon; Played Time: = Playtime
 *
 *  TEXT COLOR CODES
 *    You can also use Text Escape Codes to add text colors. Text colors
 *    codes can be added to titles and keywords separately if needed. Note 
 *    that after each lines, colors are reset
 *    
 *
 *          Example: 
 *   \C[6]location; none; \C[4]Save Time: = time; Play Time: = \C[10]playtime
 *
 *       Now lets say the game was saved at 16:24 on the map called 'map 1'
 *       and after 2 minutes of gameplay, the general section will look like 
 *       this:
 *                            **************************
 *                            * map 1    
 *                            *
 *                            * Saved Time:   16:24
 *                            * Played Time:  00:02:00
 *                            *****************************
 *                
 *       Only 'map 1' appears in the first line because no title has been
 *       assigned to it. It's text would be colored with color 6, while the
 *       following line would have color 4. The 'Play Time' title would be
 *       white, because colors are reset after each lines, but the playtime 
 *       value itself would be color 10. Note the line break induced by  
 *       adding 'none'. 
 *
 *
 * Text X
 * ======
 *    You can use this parameter to offset a bit the horizontal position
 *    of the lines of the general infos text.
 *
 *
 * Text Y
 * ======
 *    You can use this parameter to offset a bit the vertical position
 *    of the first line of the general info's text.
 *
 * Custom Text
 * ===========
 *    Set the text that will appear when using the 'custom' keyword in 
 *    the 'General List' parameter. You can use text color codes '\c[X] 
 *    and script lines with the 'eval:' keyword. 
 *
 *           Example: \C[12]eval: game.actors.actor(1).name()*
 *
 *                      *special syntax for extracting data'ss from
 *                       saved files is explained in the previous
 *                       section.
 *
 *    The example above will show the name of the first actor colored
 *    with color 12. Of course, in order to appear in the general info
 *    section, the keyword 'custom' must be includes in the 'General 
 *    List' parameter.
 *
 *          Example: we'll use the previous example of 'General List'...
 *
 * \C[6]location; custom; \C[4]Save Time: = time; Play Time: = \C[10]playtime     
 *                            
 *     The line break 'none' has been replaced by 'custom' which refer 
 *     to the 'Custom Text' parameter that we have set to first actor
 *     name above. General section would look like this:
 *
 *                         **************************
 *                         * map 1                     (color 6)
 *                         * Harold                    (color 12)
 *                         * Saved Time:   16:24       (color 4)
 *                         * Played Time:  00:02:00    (color 4 and 10)
 *                         *****************************
 *
 *
 * General Section Dim Sprite
 * ==========================
 *    This is to turn On and Off the dimmed gradient colored background
 *    behind text boxes. This affect the whole general section. 
 *
 *
 * General Section Width Offset
 * ============================
 *    This parameter is added to the General Section width. Using positive
 *    value will expend the width of the section, while negative values will
 *    reduce the width. This parameter allow the General Section to overlap 
 *    with the next section, so make your settings accordingly.
 *
 *
 *
 * SECTIONS
 * =======================================================================================
 *
 * Sections List
 * =============
 *    This parameter can be left blank if you just want to show the
 *    general section. Use the keywords 'status' and 'progress' to
 *    add optional sections separated by a SEMICOLON.
 *
 *       Example: status; progress
 *    
 *       The slots arrangement would looks like that:
 *
 *                 *********************************************
 *                 *           |               |               *
 *                 *  General  |    Status     |   Progress    *
 *                 *           |               |               *
 *                 *           |               |               *
 *                 *********************************************
 * 
 *    Refer to the 'File Window Sections' instructions above for
 *    more details on slots sections arrangement.
 *
 *
 * Dim Background Color1
 * =====================
 *    This is to set the main color of the gradient colored background
 *    dimmer sprite in all sections. It can be toggle On/Off in each 
 *    sections. Enter rgba values separated by commas.
 *
 *        Example: enter 12, 255, 80, 0.5 for rgba(12, 255, 80, 0.5)
 *
 *
 * Dim Background Color2
 * =====================
 *    This is to set the second color of the gradient colored background
 *    dimmer sprite in all sections. It can be toggle On/Off in each 
 *    sections. Enter rgba values separated by commas.
 *
 *        Example: enter 0, 160, 40, 0.5 for rgba(0, 160, 40, 0.5)
 *
 *
 *
 * STATUS SECTION
 * =======================================================================================
 *
 * Party Max Size
 * ==============
 * The Status section will be split by this value. If it is set to 1,
 * the section contents will be centered. 
 *
 *
 * Display Party Members
 * =====================
 *    You can show party members images by choosing either:
 *
 *                     'none': disable this feature
 *               'Characters': show party members character sprites
 *                    'Faces': show party members face images
 *                 'Battlers': show party members battlers sprites**
 *
 *               **Battlers sprite changes accordingly to the party
 *                 member status. It will appear as either 'normal',
 *                 'HP crisis' or 'dead'.
 *
 *
 * Display Status Gauges
 * =====================
 *    Display party members names and levels, along with HP gauges,
 *    MP gauges (if present) and TP gauges (if present). Toggle it
 *    On or Off with this parameter.
 *
 *
 * Display Battleback
 * ==================
 *    Display the Battleback1 image of the game map where the save occurs.
 *    If the map doesn't have a specified Battleback1, the Plugin will check
 *    if there's a specified Battleback2. If no Battlebacks is specified, 
 *    nothing will appears.
 *
 *    YEP_RegionBattlebacks
 *    =====================
 *    If you're using Yanfly's YEP_RegionBattlebacks, the Plugin will first
 *    check for region Battleback1 specified by Yanfly's Plugin. Then check
 *    for a region Battleback2; and then check for default Battlebacks.
 *
 *
 * Status Section Dim Sprite
 * =========================
 *    This is to turn On and Off the dimmed gradient colored background
 *    behind text boxes. This affect the whole status section
 *
 *
 * Status Section X Offset
 * =======================
 *    This parameter is added to the horizontal position of the Status
 *    section. Using positive values will move the section to the right
 *    while negative values will move it to the left. This parameter
 *    all the Status section to overlap with other sections, so make
 *    your settings accordingly.
 *
 *
 *
 * PROGRESS SECTION
 * =======================================================================================
 * The Progress section is where you can display icons, variable values
 * and other datas extracted from the saved files.
 *
 *
 *   DISPLAY OBJECT
 *      The following parameters allows to set how things will appears in 
 *      the Progress section of the slots. But the actual datas you want 
 *      to show must be entered in the 'Display Objects' parameter below.
 *      All you need to know about how to fill the 'Display Object' is 
 *      detailed in the 'TEXT OBJECTS' parameters section at the end. 
 *
 *   PROGRESS OBJECT 
 *      The Plugin has an embedded Game Progression Ratio calculation
 *      system. It will appears as a percent value of the total game
 *      progression that you can base on one or more variables defined 
 *      in the 'Progress Object'. All you need to know about how to fill  
 *      the 'Progress Object' is detailed in the 'TEXT OBJECTS' parameters  
 *      section at the end.
 *
 *
 * Progress Name
 * =============
 *    This is the name (title) that is displayed aside the Progress Ratio
 *    value. Default name is 'Progress', but you could call it 'Total',
 *    'Story Completion' or whatever what fit your game concept. Leave it 
 *    blank to disable it.
 *
 *
 * Progress Name X
 * ===============
 *    This is to set the horizontal position of the Progress Name in the
 *    slots. The position is relatives to the Progress section in the slot.
 *    This means that entering a value of 100 will position the text at
 *    100 px from the left border of the Progress section, and not from the 
 *    left border of the screen.
 *
 *
 * Progress Name Y
 * ===============
 *    This is to set the vertical position of the Progress Name in the
 *    slots. The position is relatives to the the slot itself. This means
 *    that entering a value of 100 will position the text at 100 px from
 *    the top border of the slot, and not from the top of the screen.
 *     
 *
 * Progress Name Font Size
 * =======================
 *    Set the fontSize for the Progres Name text.
 *
 *
 * Progress Ratio X
 * ================
 *    This is to set the horizontal position of the Progress Ratio in the
 *    slots. Like 'Progress Name X', the position is relatives to the slots  
 *    and is not absolute on the screen.
 *
 *
 * Progress Ratio Y
 * ================
 *    This is to set the vertical position of the Progress Ratio in the
 *    slots. Like 'Progress Name Y', the position is relatives to the slots  
 *    and is not absolute on the screen.
 *
 *
 * Progress Ratio Font Size
 * ========================
 *    Set the fontSize for the Progres Ratio text.
 *
 *
 * Progress Section Dim Sprite
 * ===========================
 *    Toggle On and Off the gradient colored background dimmer sprite
 *    for the Progress section.
 *
 *
 *    PROGRESS ICONS & DATAS
 *       In the Progress section, you will most likely display pairs of
 *       Icons/Values that you have set in the 'Display Object'. These
 *       datas will appears in the slots in a columns/rows arrangement.
 *       The following parameters allows to set the position of the first
 *       entry and the space between columns and rows. Everything else
 *       will auto adjust itself.
 *
 *
 * Progress Icons X
 * ================
 *    The horizontal position of the first data in the 'Display Object'. 
 *
 *
 * Progress Icons Y
 * ================
 *    The vertical position of the first data in the 'Display Object'.
 *
 *
 * Progress Icons Font Size
 * ========================
 *    The icons size is adjusted relatively to the current fontSize. This
 *    parameter will help you set the size of the icons and values of the
 *    'Display Object'. (see bellow)
 *
 *
 * Progress Icons Columns Number
 * =============================
 *    Set how many Icons/Values is to be displayed on one row. The data's
 *    from the 'Display Object' will fill the first row up to that number,
 *    then fill the second row and so on. The number of row will be equal 
 *    to the number of entry in the 'Display Object' divided by the number
 *    of Columns set with this parameter.
 *
 *      Example: 
 *        Lets say the 'Display Object' contains 8 values. If you set this 
 *        parameter to 3 columns. The values will appears as such:
 *
 *                    ****************************************
 *                              value 1   value 2   value 3  *
 *                              value 4   value 5   value 6  *
 *                              value 7   value 8            *
 *                                                           *
 *                           *********************************
 *
 *
 * Progress Icons Inter Column Space
 * =================================
 *    This is to set the distance in pixels between each columns of Icons/
 *    Values.
 *
 *
 * Progress Icons Inter Row Space
 * ==============================
 *    This is to set the distance in pixels between each rows of Icons/
 *    Values. This one might need some trials to find the right value
 *    depending on the slots dimension and the number of rows. If you
 *    use the dimmer sprite, some extra adjusting might also be required
 *    to make sure everythings is correctly aligned.
 *
 *
 *
 * TEXT OBJECTS (Progress)
 * =======================================================================================
 * The 2 notebox parameters bellow are where you can set the stuff you
 * want to show in the Progress section. The first one has to be filled
 * if you want anything to appear in the section. The second concern the
 * optional Progress Ratio Calculation system.
 *
 *
 * Display Object
 * ==============
 *    This is a notebox where you can link pairs of property:values
 *    separated by commas. Both properties and values will appears
 *    side by side on screen, in a columns/rows arrangement.
 *
 *       Example: 
 *          Entering this in the Display Object:
 *             potatoe: carrot, Cheeze: Milk, Harold: noob
 *
 *          Will show like this in the slots:
 *             potatoe carrot     Cheeze Milk     Harold noob  
 *
 *    The notebox accept text codes with escape characters, so you might
 *    have guess that the main purpose of this isn't to list vegetables
 *    and dairies, but rather to use pairs of Icons:Values. 
 *  
 *       Example:  
 *          Entering this in the Display Object:
 *             \i[X]: \v[Y]
 *
 *          Will show icon X alongside variable Y value.
 * 
 *    The notebox can be filled both horizontally or vertically, and
 *    whites spaces doesn't matter. Just be sure to separate each pairs
 *    of Icons:Values with comas.
 *
 *       Example:
 *          Data's can be entered like this:
 *                \i[1]:\v[1], \i[2]:\v[2], \i[3]:\v[3]
 *
 *          Or like this:
 *                \i[1]:\v[1],
 *                \i[2]:\v[2],
 *                \i[3]:\v[3]
 *
 *          Or like this:
 *                \i[1]:\v[1], \i[2]:\v[2],
 *                \i[3]:\v[3]         
 *
 *    The actual arrangement of the notebox doesn't change the way things
 *    will appears in the slots. Only the order of the entries is important.
 *    Remember that in the slots, the pairs of Icons:Values will be shown 
 *    in a columns/rows arrangement that is defined by the Progress section 
 *    parameters above.
 *
 *    You can put as many entries as you want, but keep in mind that the 
 *    more stuff you put, smaller the font and icons will be. And depending  
 *    on the actual slot dimemsions, things just might appears too small and
 *    uneasthetic.
 *
 *    This feature is mostly made for showing pairs of Icons:Values, but
 *    you can show anything you want. Here's a few tips:
 *
 *       Show only icons with no values
 *
 *                      \i[1]: , \i[2]: , \i[3]: 
 *
 *       Show a colored text before the variable value. Notice the second
 *       double dot added so there will be a double dot between the text
 *       and the value on screen.
 *
 *            \c[4]some text\C:: \v[1], \c[6]some other text\C:: \v[2]
 *
 *       You can mix text and icons           
 *
 *        \i[1]\c[4]some text\C:: \v[1], \i[2]\c[6]some other text\C:: \v[2]
 *
 *            **you can use long text string but the 'Progress Icons Inter 
 *              Column Space' parameter should be set accordingly, otherwise
 *              some stuff might overlap.
 *
 *            **If you use TSR_TextColorAddOn, don't use text color gradient
 *              codes in the 'Display Object' notebox. The comma inside the
 *              square brackets of the gradient code will mess your Display 
 *              Object.
 *
 *
 *    USING SCRIPT IN THE DISPLAY OBJECT
 *       You can use script lines to show other datas from the saved files 
 *       in the Progress section. The special syntax required to extract 
 *       data's is explained in previous intructions above. Only the values, 
 *       not the properties, can be assigned some script in your Display 
 *       Object. Use the keyword 'eval:'  to add script.
 *
 *          Example:  Total steps:: eval: game.party.steps(),
 *                    \i[370]: eval: game.party.gold()
 *
 *       In the example above, the Display Object is filled with 2 entry.
 *       In the first one, the text 'Total Steps:' is assigned to the total
 *       steps made by the party in the saved file. In the second entry, 
 *       icon 370 is assigned to the party gold.
 *
 *       You can use conditionnal branch too.
 *
 *          Example: 
 *             \c[6]Currency:: eval: if (game.switches.value(1) == true) {
 *                                       game.variables.value(10)
 *                                    } else {
 *                                       game.variables.value(11) },
 *             Total steps:: eval: game.party.steps(),
 *             \i[370]: eval: game.party.gold()
 *
 *       In this example above, the colored text 'Currency:' is assigned
 *       to variable 10 value if game switch 1 is On. Otherwise it'll be
 *       assigned to variable 11. The Display Object also contains the 2
 *       entries from the previous example. The 3 pairs of property/value
 *       are separated by commas.
 *
 *
 *    BOOLEANS
 *       No matter the script you use, it will return a 'value', most likely
 *       a text string or a numeric value. But if the returning value is a
 *       boolean (true or false), it will tell the Plugin to either show or
 *       hide the object propety name.
 *
 *          Example:
 *             \i[200]: eval: game.switches.value(2)
 *
 *       This way, icon 200 will appear if game switch 2 is ON. Otherwise,
 *       nothing will be shown.
 *
 *
 *    NOTE ON EMPTY VALUES
 *       If you show variables values by using the text code '\v[x]' in the
 *       Display Object and the variable is equal to zero, no value will be
 *       shown. Only the icon will appear. But if you show the variable value
 *       using 'eval: game.variables.value(x)', nothing will be shown if the
 *       variable equal zero because javascript will interpret it as boolean
 *       'false'.
 *
 *       If you really need to show the zero value along with the icon, use
 *       a conditional branch.
 *
 *          Example:
 *             \i[200]: eval: if (game.variables.value(3)) {
 *                              game.variables.value(3)
 *                            } else {
 *                               '0'
 *                            }, 
 *
 *       In the example above, icon 200 will always appears and the value
 *       will show 0 if the variable is unassigned.        
 *
 *
 *
 * Progress Object
 * ===============
 *    This text Object serves for the Progress Ratio Calculation system.
 *    If you do not wish to use this feature, simply leave the notebox
 *    empty. 
 *
 *    It is working in synergy with the 'Display Object', thus it will
 *    be assumed, in the following instructions, that you are already 
 *    familiar with its functionning.
 *
 *    In the Progress Object, you can enter some properties of the 'Display
 *    Object' and assign them a maximum value. The Progress Ratio will be
 *    calculated as the ratio of the sums of all 'Progress' variables on
 *    the sums of all their corresponding maximum values. Now this sound
 *    more complicated than it is. A few examples will illustrate better
 *    the concept.
 *
 *       Example:
 *          Lets say the Display Object is filled like this:
 *
 *             Display Object: \i[1]:\v[1], \i[2]:\v[2], \i[3]:\v[3]
 *    
 *          This will show icon 1 with variable 1 value, icon 2 with
 *          variables 2... We already talked about that previously.
 *
 *          Now, let's say we want to use variable 3 for displaying a 
 *          completion ratio. For simplicity, we'll assign it a max
 *          value of 100. The Progress Object would look like this:
 *
 *             Progress Object: \i[3]: 100
 *
 *          As you can see, variable 3 is assigned a maximum value of
 *          100 in the Progress Object by refering to its property
 *          name in the Display Object, which in this case is '\i[3]'.
 *          With this setting, the Progress Ratio will be calculated
 *          as (variable 3 value / 100). Meaning that if variable 3
 *          has a value of 50, a Progress Ratio of 50% will show. The
 *          maximum being 100, the Progress Ratio would be 100% even
 *          if variable 3 would have a value of 3000.
 *
 *
 *       Example:
 *         Now lets includes all entries of the Display Object above
 *         in the Progress Object and assign them different maximum
 *         values:
 *
 *            Progress Object: \i[1]: 200, \i[2]: 50, \i[3]: 100
 *
 *         This time, if variable 3 would have a value of 3000, it 
 *         would only account for 28.6% of the Progress Ratio. The
 *         maximum value assign to variable 3 is 100, so even if it
 *         has a value of 3000, only 100 will be taken in account.
 *         The sums of all maximum values in the Progress Object is
 *         (200 + 50 + 100 = 350), and (100 / 350 = 0.286).
 *         
 *
 *    So, we saw that in order to be includes in the Progress Ratio, a
 *    variable value from the Display Object must be assigned a maximum
 *    value in the Progress Object. The variable value and its maximum
 *    value are linked together by giving them the same property name
 *    in both Text Objects.
 *
 *    That means that any value you want to be part of the Progress Ratio
 *    Calculation, must be included in the Display Object. But what if you
 *    don't want the actual variable(s) used for displaying the Progress 
 *    Ratio percent value to appears in the slots?
 *
 *
 *    HIDDING VALUES  
 *       We know that the Display Object serves to show pairs of property/
 *       value, most likely Icons/Variables pairs, in the Progress section
 *       of the slots. If a property name includes the keyword 'progress',
 *       the paired value will never be shown.
 *
 *          Example:
 *             Lets say the Display Object is filled like this:
 *
 *             Display Object: \i[1]:\v[1], \i[2]:\v[2], progress1:\v[3]
 *
 *       In the above example, only variable value 1 and 2 will appears in
 *       the slot alongside their paired icons. Variable 3 is paired with
 *       a property name that contains 'progress'. It will remains hidden.
 *
 *       Now, we could assign a maximum value to variable 3 by using the 
 *       same 'progress1' property name in the Progress Object. That way,
 *       the variable 3 value is used for Progress Ratio Calculation, but
 *       don't appears with other pairs of Icons/Values of the Display
 *       Object. 
 *
 *       Note that I used 'progress1' as the property name. But anything
 *       that includes the characters sequence p-r-o-g-r-e-s-s would do.
 *       Best way is to use numeric or alphabetic ordination like: progress1,
 *       progress2, progress3, or progressA, Bprogress...
 *
 *       You can use any combination of displayed and/or hidden variables
 *       values for your Progress Ratio Calculation.
 *
